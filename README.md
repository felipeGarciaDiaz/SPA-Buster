# SPA-Buster
Security based tool, meant to scrape spa sites ** any site really **, clicking all interactable elements and repeating this in order to find existing routes / directories. Especially useful for spa's since these sites are typically a bit more complicated in the required routes.

Currently just a quick tool I made for a project I wanted auto-mated, but planning on adding updates to it to make it into a robus security tool for obtaining routes and directories on any type of sites, especially spa sites.

## TODO

- Add a NodeJS version
- Add customization
- Improve accuracy of routes obtained.
